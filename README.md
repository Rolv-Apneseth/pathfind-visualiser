# pathfind-visualiser
 Pygame program which visualises different pathfinding algorithms

Algorithms:
            A* pathfinding algorithm
            Breadth first search
            Depth first search
            Dijkstra's best path algorithm
            Greedy best-first search

Options to choose maze type and number of rows are also included.

Maze types:
            Random - All nodes have a 25% chance of becoming a barrier node
            Swirl - Basic swirl pattern which takes up the entire grid
            Imperfect - My first attempt at a proper maze generating algorithm. Not perfect but not terrible.

To use, execute the main.py.
Choose the algorithm you would like to see. Then, left click on 2 different nodes to set the start and end points, and left click more to set the barriers.
Then, press spacebar to visualise the algorithm.
