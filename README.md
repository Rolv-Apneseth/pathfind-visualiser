# pathfind-visualiser
 Pygame program which visualises different pathfinding algorithms

Currently contains: A* pathfinding algorithm
                    Breadth first search
                    Depth first search
                    Dijkstra's best path algorithm
                    Greedy best-first search

Options to choose maze type and number of rows are also included.

To use, execute the main.py.
Choose the algorithm you would like to see. Then, left click on 2 different nodes to set the start and end points, and left click more to set the barriers.
Then, press spacebar to visualise the algorithm.
